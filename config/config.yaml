# Main config to direct workflow to user data
# also intending for this to be editable through a GUI later

#TODO:
# This solution involves rewriting the hardcoded output of the snakemake
# to have the workflow look at a different location to keep track of the project
# importantly we need to see where the .snakefiles get saved and see if
# launching the same conda environment through an app will allow for easy project switching
#
# snakefiles are saved to this location to remember the run so this idea is probably not the best way of running it

# Project location
projdir: "C:/Users/benjad/OneDrive - Michigan Medicine/Projects/RNAseq-SnApp"

# Inputs
counts: "resources/data_small.csv"
meta: "resources/meta.csv"
nf_dds: "resources/nf_dds.dds.Rdata"
formula: "resources/formula.txt"

# Params
# a location for extra parameters with reasonable defaults to fill out later

#Outputs
resultsdir: "results"
